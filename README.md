# Africa-Reach
Worked with a team of 8 in Google's BGN Hackathon Autumn 2021 and created a Flutter application that matches job seekers with recruiters to tackle the issue of unemployment in African youth.
The application uses a cosine similarity recommendation system to provider users with personalised job suggestions.

## How it works
- User creates an account to login
- If user presses the heart icon, that job posting will be saved to 'favourites', and a similar job posting will be suggesting next
- If user presses the double-arrow icon, that job posting will not be used when recommending the next posting
- If the user presses 'favourites', user can scroll through all the postings that they favourited which can direct them to the link to apply

## Future improvement
- Enabling filters e.g. if user just wants to see remote jobs only
- More easy-to-use UI by swiping right or left if favourited job posting or skip
- Improve recommendation system by using Matrix Factorization which recommends job posts based on similar user preferences
- Enable recruiters to invite candidates by looking at CVs in a similar way
- User inbox to check if they have recieved an invitation

## Team
- BGN Hackathon 2021 lasted between Oct 29th to Nov 1st. 
- Will be adding further iterations to develop my Flutter programming skills and as it is an application I am passionate about.
